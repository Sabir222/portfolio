## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Sabir KOUTABI, a self-taught developer on an exciting journey to master front-end development and beyond. As an aspiring web developer, I've been honing my skills in Next13/React, CSS/Tailwind, and Typescript, and I'm now eager to dive deeper into front-end technologies to create beautiful and intuitive user experiences.

## About Me

My passion for coding and technology started as a personal project, where I taught myself the basics of programming through online resources and tutorials. As I progressed, I discovered my love for web development and the limitless possibilities it offers to express creativity and solve real-world problems.
