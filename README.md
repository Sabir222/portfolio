# Sabir KOUTABI - Developer Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Sabir KOUTABI, a self-taught developer on an exciting journey to master front-end development and beyond. As an aspiring web developer, I've been honing my skills in Next13/React, CSS/Tailwind, and Typescript, and I'm now eager to dive deeper into front-end technologies to create beautiful and intuitive user experiences.

## About Me

My passion for coding and technology started as a personal project, where I taught myself the basics of programming through online resources and tutorials. As I progressed, I discovered my love for web development and the limitless possibilities it offers to express creativity and solve real-world problems.

### Technologies Used

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/): I believe in the power of strong typing and how TypeScript enhances code quality and developer productivity.
[Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/docs): Next.js provides a fantastic framework for building server-rendered React applications with ease.
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation): For designing stunning and responsive UI components, I utilize Tailwind CSS - a utility-first CSS framework.
[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS): I also make use of CSS to add more personalized styles to my projects.
